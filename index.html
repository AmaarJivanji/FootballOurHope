		<h3> What is the significance and vision of Football Our Hope? </h3>
		<p> Streetchildren are amongst the most physically visible of all children on the planet; living and working on streets in cities all over  the world. However, stigmatizing and limiting societal notions by mainstream society force street children to be arguably the most invisible and vulnerable children of our time. </p>

       		 <p> 
       		 Streetchildren manage to fight off isolation and divert their mindsets from vices such as theft, violent extremism and theft. FOH is not just a charitable organization but, one that also teaches important life skills and works to develop strong, postive mindsets.
